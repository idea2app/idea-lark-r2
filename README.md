# idea2app-lark-R2

This Cloudflare worker uploads images synchronously from lark base to R2 object storage. To utilize this functionality, you need to set up a lark base workflow which sends an HTTP request to the worker. Subsequently, the worker retrieves the image from Lark and transfers it to R2

## Preset

### Cloudflare authentication

You'll need to configure Wrangler using GitHub's Secrets feature - go to "Settings -> Secrets" and add your Cloudflare API token (for help finding this, see the [Workers documentation][5]). Your API token is encrypted by GitHub, and the action won't print it into logs, so it should be safe!

### Lark config

<!-- @todo add feishu and lark link -->

1.  [Create an workflow][6]

2.  Custom trigger
    Select the field where the image is located, use the image modification as a trigger condition

<!-- @todo add feishu and lark link -->

3.  [Send an HTTP request][7]
    Your HTTP request should resemble the following:
    `POST https://BUCKET_BASE_URL/lark?file_token=REDACTED&name=hello.png&type=image%2Fpng`
    There for, you are required to include the `file_token`, `name` and `type` fields in your query parameters

### Github Action config

Set GitHub action variables properly to automatically deploy after every push

<!-- @todo add feishu and lark link -->

```yml
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/#api-token
apiToken:
secrets: |
# [en] https://open.larksuite.com/document/home/interactive-message-card-sending/create-app-request-permission
    LARK_ID
    LARK_SECRET
# Auth with custom header (X-Lark-Upload-Token)
    LARK_UPLOAD_KEY
vars: |
# default to be https://open.larksuite.com/open-apis/
    LARK_HOST
# your bucket base url, which you can set later with custom domains
    BUCKET_BASE_URL
```

```shell
npm i pnpm -g

pnpm i
